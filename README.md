## Hi there I'm Sophie 👋 

 👩‍💻 I work as a Software Engineer for <a href="https://curipod.com/">Curipod</a>, a Norwegian ed-tech company building the worlds first curiosity platform.
 
 🥞 Stack: Currently have most experience with React, Typescript, Next.js, Styled-components, Node.js, and always up for learning something new.

🌱 I studied Front-end development at <a href="https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development">Noroff</a> learning both web design and development.

🐘 I also have a BSc in Zoology and MSc in Evolutionary Ecology from Exeter University.

📫 If you want to see more of my work or contact me visit <a href="https://soph-web-dev.eu/">my site</a>.

🦸‍♀️ My secret super power: solving code problems while I sleep. Every time I have been really stuck on a problem, I have woken up having dream-solved it. 

⚡ Fun fact: I write crochet patterns, making awesome things in my spare time, like this Bowtruckle!
